We have the overall design for the app, now we need to implement the functionality.

The main functionality we need to implement is the ability to schedule trips, services, and expenses.

We also need to be able to view trip info, vehicle info, and driver info.

The app will pull the data from Geotab API.

We need to address the data architecture for the app, that maps the data from Geotab API to the app's data model.

Geotab will give up the data about the vehicles, drivers, and trips.

Our app will post vehicle, driver and trip info to Geotab API.

We will use SQLite to store the data in the local database.

We will use Expo SQLite to handle the SQLite database.
